    Usage: $ mass_mailer.py [--dry-run] <config.ini> <mail.html|txt> <emails.csv>

Sends an individualised version of `mail.html|txt` to all recipient email
addresses contained in `emails.csv`;  configuration details such as mail server
or header fields are read from `config.ini`.

The following fields inside `config.ini` are required:

    SMTP=smtp.example.org
    FROM=someone@example.org
    SUBJECT=Mails without subject would not make sense, right?!

There also are some optional settings:

    REPLY-TO=someone@example.org (defaults to FROM address)
    BCC=someone-to-get-bcc-copies@example.org
    FIRST_LASTNAME=Sir or Madam

The `mail.html|txt` file may contain HTML markup and should be saved in UTF-8
encoding;  there is one "special" placeholder `{{FIRST_LASTNAME}}` which can be
used to insert the personalised recipient name into the email.  If the name
cannot be resolved from the email address, the script will use `FIRST_LASTNAME`
from `config.ini`, iff available, defaulting to `"Sir or Madam"` otherwise.

A template ending with extension ".txt" triggers sending of plain text emails.

Email addresses should be given in comma-separated list form, e.g.:

    # firstname,lastname,email
    John,Doe,john@example.org
    ,,noname@example.org

You can use the optional `"--dry-run"` flag to run the script in testing mode
which will do everything except sending out the actual emails.

It is a wise idea to test any new `mail.html|txt` or `config.ini` with your own
email address first.  The author does not any responsibility for emails sent
out with this tool.  By using the script, you accept this.
